          <p>Programming languages all have built-in data structures, but these often differ from one language to another. This article attempts to list the built-in data structures available in JavaScript and what properties they have. These can be used to build other data structures. Wherever possible, comparisons with other languages are drawn.</p>

        <a href="">Dynamic typing</a>
        <p>JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic language. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types:</p>

        <p>let foo = 42;   // foo is now a number</p>
        <p>foo = ‘bar’;    // foo is now a string</p>
        <p>foo = true;     // foo is now a boolean</p>
